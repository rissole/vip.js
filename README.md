# vip.js
An implementation of [vip.swf](http://vip.aersia.net/vip.swf) in Javascript using [JPlayer](http://www.jplayer.org/). This allows vip to be enjoyed on mobile devices.

The skin used is [Midnight Black](https://github.com/TheInfection/Midnight-Black), specifically [the responsive version](http://www.mediafire.com/?axx792ad525dvp5) the author made, which is absolutely fantastic.

# Notes
This is not much more than a JPlayer playlist populated with song data from vip's [roster.xml](http://vip.aersia.net/roster.xml). Extra things I've done are:

* The styling in index.html to make the controls fixed position.
* Changed the shuffling behaviour of JPlayer playlist extension to match vip.swf's.
* Added a Favourites system.
